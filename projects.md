## OpenSource Projects
I'm involved in different OpenSource Projects because of many reasons. First of all I'm working for [Red Hat](http://www.redhat.com) which is a OpenSource Company. So I'm lucky enough to work on them as part of my job. But not all are related to them, as most of all it is my passion.

This page tries to list all of them:

##### [Vert.x](http://vertx.io)
